ASEE-2015
=========
This is our ASEE GitHub respository. This readme is here to give some guidelines on our code structure, and other things we may think of.

An example of good code structure is in the Conveyor library.

Adding Your Changes to Master Repository

1) You can open the files in your fork and edit them any way you like. 
2) Once you have edited them and want them to be added to the source files, you need to first commit the changes you've made by using the GitHub application.
3) After that, go to your fork on your account at github.com. 
4) Then click the green box titled "create pull request". 
5) After you make your pull request, the changes you made will be reviewed and added to the source files. 

More, detailed information is here: https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/
