ASEE-2015
=========
This is our ASEE GitHub respository. This readme is here to give some guidelines on our code structure, and other things we may think of.

An example of good code structure is in the Conveyor library. 

=====
Adding Your Changes to Master Repository

1. You can open the files in your fork and edit them any way you like. 
2. Once you have edited them and want them to be added to the source files, you need to first commit the changes you've made by using the GitHub application.
3. After that, go to your fork on your account at github.com. 
4. Then click the green box titled "create pull request". 
5. After you make your pull request, the changes you made will be reviewed and added to the source files. 

More, detailed information is here: https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/

=====
Keeping Your Fork Up-To-Date with the Master Repository

To update your fork so that it contains the newest additions to the master repository, follow these directions:

1. Using the shell: https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/
2. Using github.com:
  1. Go to your account on GitHub.com
  2. Open your fork on GitHub(ASEE-2015).
  3. Click on Pull Requests.
  4. Click on New Pull Request. By default, GitHub will compare the original with your fork, and there shouldn’t be anything to compare if you didn’t make any changes.
  5. Click on switching the base (if no changes were made in the fork) or click Edit and switch the base manually. Now GitHub     will compare your fork with the original, and you should see all the latest changes.
  6. Click to create a pull request for this comparison and assign a predictable name to your pull request (e.g., Update from original).
  7. Click on Send pull request.
  8. Scroll down and click Merge pull request and finally Confirm merge. If your fork didn’t have any changes, you will be able to merge it automatically.
