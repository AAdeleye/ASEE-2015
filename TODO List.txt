******ASEE Software Team TODO List*******

This is our TODO list. Feel free to delete things off here once they are completed, or add things here you think need doing.

***********************
General:
-Make a BinSystem library that manages the bins
-Test out all of our libraries independently once we've made a test sketch for them.
-Make the "main sketch", includes all the libraries we've made into one package so we can test everything. AKA The Final Product
-Update UML on wiki to match our current software design

***************************
Conveyor Library:
-Conveyor.h
--change private variables to have _underscore names
--add comment to functions, classes, enums, and variables
--change goToPosition to have the ClawPosition enum as the parameter
--change constructor to accept pin number of the limit switches, motorSpeed and servo angles as parameters
--add comment to ClawPosition enum: numbers = pin numbers for servos

-Conveyor.cpp
--fix openClaw() method (currently closes claw)
--fix constructor(based on .h file)
--fix goToPosition(based on .h file)

-Test Sketch
--make one that tests all functions of this library

**************************
Drivetrain Library:
-Drivetrain.h
--add comments to functions, classes, and variables
--change parameter name of goSpeed to power

-Drivetrain.cpp
--finish the rotate() function (add more steps)

-Test Sketch
--make one that test all the functions of this library

**************************
Visual Sensor Library:
-VisualSensor.h
--add comments for functions, variables and classes
--rename pixy to _pixy

-VisualSensor.cpp
--rename pixy to _pixy

-Test Sketch
--Make one that tests all the functions of this library
