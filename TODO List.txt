******ASEE Software Team TODO List*******

This is our TODO list. Feel free to delete things off here once they are completed, or add things here you think need doing.

***********************
General:
-Make a BinSystem library that manages the bins
-Make the "main sketch", includes all the libraries we've made into one package so we can test everything. AKA The Final Product
-Update UML on wiki to match our current software design

***************************
(1-31-15) Track Test Run

-Test our sketch around the track, stopping briefly at each fish (4 sec)
--Fill out correct array times to stop the right amount of time

**************************
(1-31-15) Conveyor Library:
-Conveyor.h
--add comment to functions, classes, enums, and variables

-Test Sketch
--make one that tests all functions of this library

**************************
Drivetrain Library: (Done for now)

-Implement PID control to tune the motors so they turn at same speed(go in straight line)
--May not be needed

**************************
Visual Sensor Library: (Done for now)


**************************
Stop using delay() in programs and functions in libraries

-delay() causes the program to stop for a specified amount of time.
	This means the program is required to do something until the amount of time has
	passed. So we can't do multiple things at once(like picking up a fish AND 
	rotating the robot) if we use delay(). Found an	alternative to delay here:
