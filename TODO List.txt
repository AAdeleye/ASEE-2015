******ASEE Software Team TODO List*******

This is our TODO list. Feel free to delete things off here once they are completed, or add things here you think need doing.

***********************
General:
-Make a BinSystem library that manages the bins
-Test out all of our libraries independently once we've made a test sketch for them.
-Make the "main sketch", includes all the libraries we've made into one package so we can test everything. AKA The Final Product
-Update UML on wiki to match our current software design

***************************
(1-31-15) Track Test Run (Sanmi and Robert)
- (1-28-15) Make a test sketch including drivetrain and visualSensor library
--Finish drivetrain and visualSensor library

-Will test out a path around the track, stopping briefly at each fish (4 sec)

**************************
(1-31-15) Conveyor Library:
-Conveyor.h
--add comment to functions, classes, enums, and variables

-Conveyor.cpp

-Test Sketch
--make one that tests all functions of this library

**************************
(1-28-15) Drivetrain Library: (Bryce and Whitney)

-Drivetrain.cpp
--finish the rotate() function (add more steps), need to test this function to get the right times for the array

-Test Sketch
--Made a test sketch, need to actually test it

**************************
(1-28-15) Visual Sensor Library: (Whitney and Bryce)
-VisualSensor.h
--add comments for functions, variables and classes
--rename pixy to _pixy

-VisualSensor.cpp
--rename pixy to _pixy

-Test Sketch
--Make one that tests all the functions of this library

**************************
Stop using delay() in programs and functions in libraries

-delay() causes the program to stop for a specified amount of time.
	This means the program is required to do something until the amount of time has
	passed. So we can't do multiple things at once(like picking up a fish AND 
	rotating the robot) if we use delay(). Found an	alternative to delay here:
